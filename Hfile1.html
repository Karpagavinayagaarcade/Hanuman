<p>The Ramayana is a Sanskrit epic traditionally attributed to the sage Valmiki, recounting the life and adventures of Rama, a prince of Ayodhya. It is one of the two major epics of Hindu literature, the other being the Mahabharata. The epic narrates Rama's exile, the abduction of his wife Sita by the demon king Ravana, and the subsequent war to rescue her. </p>
